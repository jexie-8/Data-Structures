1. Vector: a dynamic array that can automatically resize as you add (shown in the code with push_back()). The code shows how to add elements with push_back(), change (using indexing), access (with 3 different ways), and remove them (using pop_back()). Vectors store data in contiguous memory like regular arrays its fast to access elements.

2. Stacks: they work using 'Last In, First Out (LIFO)' which means the last item added is the first item to be removed. The code show how to push elements using push(), print them, remove top elements using top(), check if the stack is empty or not using empty(), and find the size using size().

3. Queues: they work using 'First In, First Out (FIFO)' meaning the first item added is the first item to be removed. The code adds and removes elements using push() and pop(), prints all items using a loop, checks if the queue is empty, and shows the front, back, and size (uses empty(), fornt(), back(), and size()).

4. Linked Lists: they are a series of connected nodes, each pointing to the next. The code builds a simple linked list, inserts nodes at the beginning, middle, and end. It also deletes nodes and traverses to print all elements.
